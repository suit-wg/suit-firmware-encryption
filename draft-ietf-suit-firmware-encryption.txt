Abstract

   This document specifies techniques for encrypting software, firmware,
   machine learning models, and personalization data by utilizing the
   IETF SUIT manifest.  Key agreement is provided by ephemeral-static
   (ES) Diffie-Hellman (DH) and AES Key Wrap (AES-KW).  ES-DH uses
   public key cryptography while AES-KW uses a pre-shared key.
   Encryption of the plaintext is accomplished with conventional
   symmetric key cryptography.

Internet-Draft    Encrypted Payloads in SUIT Manifests    September 2023


1.  Introduction

   Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the
   need for a reliable and secure firmware update mechanism that is also
   suitable for constrained devices.  To protect firmware images, the
   SUIT manifest format was developed [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest].  It
   provides a bundle of metadata, including where to find the payload,
   the devices to which it applies and a security wrapper.

   [RFC9124] details the information that has to be provided by the SUIT
   manifest format.  In addition to offering protection against
   modification, via a digital signature or a message authentication
   code, confidentiality may also be afforded.

   Encryption prevents third parties, including attackers, from gaining
   access to the payload.  Attackers typically need intimate knowledge
   of a binary, such as a firmware image, to mount their attacks.  For
   example, return-oriented programming (ROP) [ROP] requires access to
   the binary and encryption makes it much more difficult to write
   exploits.

   While the original motivating use case of this document was firmware
   encryption, the use of SUIT manifests has been extended to other use
   cases requiring integrity and confidentiality protection, such as:

   *  software packages,

   *  personalization data,

   *  configuration data, and

   *  machine learning models.

   Hence, we use the term payload to generically refer to all those
   objects.

   The payload is encrypted using a symmetric content encryption key,
   which can be established using a variety of mechanisms; this document
   defines two content key distribution methods for use with the IETF
   SUIT manifest, namely:

   *  Ephemeral-Static (ES) Diffie-Hellman (DH), and

   *  AES Key Wrap (AES-KW).

   The former method relies on asymmetric key cryptography while the
   latter uses symmetric key cryptography.

Internet-Draft    Encrypted Payloads in SUIT Manifests    September 2023


   Our goal was to reduce the number of content key distribution methods
   for use with payload encryption and thereby increase interoperability
   between different SUIT manifest parser implementations.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document assumes familiarity with the IETF SUIT manifest
   [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest], the SUIT information model [RFC9124], and
   the SUIT architecture [RFC9019].

   The following abbreviations are used in this document:

   *  Key Wrap (KW), defined in [RFC3394] (for use with AES)

   *  Key-Encryption Key (KEK) [RFC3394]

   *  Content-Encryption Key (CEK) [RFC5652]

   *  Ephemeral-Static (ES) Diffie-Hellman (DH) [RFC9052]

   The terms sender and recipient have the following meaning:

   *  Sender: Entity that sends an encrypted payload.

   *  Recipient: Entity that receives an encrypted payload.

   Additionally, we introduce the term "distribution system" (or
   distributor) to refer to an entity that knows the recipients of
   payloads.  It is important to note that the distribution system is
   far more than a file server.  For use of encryption, the distribution
   system either knows the public key of the recipient (for ES-DH), or
   the KEK (for AES-KW).

   The author, which is responsible for creating the payload, does not
   know the recipients.

   The author and the distribution system are logical roles.  In some
   deployments these roles are separated in different physical entities
   and in others they are co-located.

3.  Architecture

   [RFC9019] describes the architecture for distributing payloads and
   manifests from an author to devices.  It does, however, not detail
   the use of payload encryption.  This document enhances the
   architecture to support encryption.

   Figure 1 shows the distribution system, which represents a file
   server and the device management infrastructure.

   The sender (author) needs to know the recipient (device) to use
   encryption.  For AES-KW, the KEK needs to be known and, in case of
   ES-DH, the sender needs to be in possession of the public key of the
   recipient.  The public key and parameters may be in the recipient's
   X.509 certificate [RFC5280].  For authentication of the sender and
   for integrity protection the recipients must be provisioned with a
   trust anchor when a manifest is protected using a digital signature.
   When a MAC is used to protect the manifest then a symmetric key must
   be shared by the recipient and the sender.

   With encryption, the author cannot just create a manifest for the
   payload and sign it, since the subsequent encryption step by the
   distribution system would invalidate the signature over the manifest.
   (The content key distribution information is embedded inside the
   COSE_Encrypt structure, which is included in the SUIT manifest.)
   Hence, the author has to collaborate with the distribution system.
   The varying degree of collaboration is discussed below.

     Figure 1: Architecture for the distribution of Encrypted Payloads.

   The author has several deployment options, namely:

   *  The author, as the sender, obtains information about the
      recipients and their keys from the distribution system.  Then, it
      performs the necessary steps to encrypt the payload.  As a last
      step it creates one or more manifests.  The device(s) perform
      decryption and act as recipients.

   *  The author treats the distribution system as the initial
      recipient.  Then, the distribution system decrypts and re-encrypts
      the payload for consumption by the device (or the devices).
      Delegating the task of re-encrypting the payload to the
      distribution system offers flexibility when the number of devices
      that need to receive encrypted payloads changes dynamically or
      when updates to KEKs or recipient public keys are necessary.  As a
      downside, the author needs to trust the distribution system with
      performing the re-encryption of the payload.

   If the author delegates encryption rights to the distributor two
   models are possible:

   1.  The distributor replaces the COSE_Encrypt in the manifest and
       then signs the manifest again.  However, the COSE_Encrypt
       structure is contained within a signed container, which presents



Tschofenig, et al.        Expires 14 March 2024                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    Encrypted Payloads in SUIT Manifests    September 2023


       a problem: replacing the COSE_Encrypt with a new one will cause
       the digest of the manifest to change, thereby changing the
       signature.  This means that the distributor must be able to sign
       the new manifest.  If this is the case, then the distributor
       gains the ability to construct and sign manifests, which allows
       the distributor the authority to sign code, effectively
       presenting the distributor with full control over the recipient.
       Because distributors typically perform their re-encryption online
       in order to handle a large number of devices in a timely fashion,
       it is not possible to air-gap the distributor's signing
       operations.  This impacts the recommendations in Section 4.3.17
       of [RFC9124].

   2.  The distributor uses a two-manifest system.  More precisely, the
       distributor constructs a new manifest that overrides the
       COSE_Encrypt using the dependency system defined in
       [I-D.ietf-suit-trust-domains].  This incurs additional overhead:
       one additional signature verification and one additional
       manifest, as well as the additional machinery in the recipient
       needed for dependency processing.

   These two models also present different threat profiles for the
   distributor.  If the distributor only has encryption rights, then an
   attacker who breaches the distributor can only mount a limited
   attack: they can encrypt a modified binary, but the recipients will
   identify the attack as soon as they perform the required image digest
   check and revert back to a correct image immediately.

   It is RECOMMENDED that distributors are implemented using a two-
   manifest system in order to distribute content encryption keys
   without requiring re-signing of the manifest, despite the increase in
   complexity and greater number of signature verifications that this
   imposes on the recipient.

4.  Encryption Extensions

   This specification introduces a new extension to the SUIT_Parameters
   structure.

   The SUIT_Encryption_Info structure (called suit-parameter-encryption-
   info in Figure 2) contains the content key distribution information.
   The content of the SUIT_Encryption_Info structure is explained in
   Section 6.1 (for AES-KW) and in Section 6.2 (for ES-DH).

   Once a CEK is available, the steps described in Section 6.3 are
   applicable.  These steps apply to both content key distribution
   methods described in this section.

Internet-Draft    Encrypted Payloads in SUIT Manifests    September 2023


   The SUIT_Encryption_Info structure is either carried inside the suit-
   directive-override-parameters or the suit-directive-set-parameters
   parameters used in the "Directive Write" and "Directive Copy"
   directives.  An implementation claiming conformance with this
   specification must implement support for these two parameters.  Since
   a device will typically only support one of the content key
   distribution methods, the distribution system needs to know which of
   two specified methods wis supported.  Mandating only a single content
   key distribution method for a constrained device also reduces the
   code size.

   SUIT_Parameters //= (suit-parameter-encryption-info
       => bstr .cbor SUIT_Encryption_Info)

   suit-parameter-encryption-info = 19

              Figure 2: CDDL of the SUIT_Parameters Extension.

   RFC Editor's Note (TBD19): The value for the suit-parameter-
   encryption-info parameter is set to 19, as the proposed value.]

5.  Extended Directives

   This specification extends these directives:

   *  Directive Write (suit-directive-write) to decrypt the content
      specified by suit-parameter-content with suit-parameter-
      encryption-info.

   *  Directive Copy (suit-directive-copy) to decrypt the content of the
      component specified by suit-parameter-source-component with suit-
      parameter-encryption-info.

   Examples of the two directives are shown below.

   Figure 3 illustrates the Directive Write.  The encrypted payload
   specified with parameter-content, namely h'EA1...CED' in the example,
   is decrypted using the SUIT_Encryption_Info structure referred to by
   parameter-encryption-info, i.e., h'D86...1F0'.  The resulting
   plaintext payload is stored into component #0.

   / directive-override-parameters / 20, {
     / parameter-content / 18: h'EA1...CED',
     / parameter-encryption-info / 19: h'D86...1F0'
   },
   / directive-write / 18, 15

        Figure 3: Example showing the extended suit-directive-write.

Internet-Draft    Encrypted Payloads in SUIT Manifests    September 2023


   Figure 4 illustrates the Directive Copy.  In this example the
   encrypted payload is found at the URI indicated by the parameter-uri,
   i.e. "http://example.com/encrypted.bin".  The encrypted payload will
   be downloaded and stored in component #1.  Then, the information in
   the SUIT_Encryption_Info structure of the parameter-encryption-info,
   i.e. h'D86...1F0', will be used to decrypt the content in component
   #1 and the resulting plaintext payload will be stored into component
   #0.

   / directive-set-component-index / 12, 1,
   / directive-override-parameters / 20, {
     / parameter-uri / 21: "http://example.com/encrypted.bin",
   },
   / directive-fetch / 21, 15,
   / directive-set-component-index / 12, 0,
   / directive-override-parameters / 20, {
     / parameter-source-component / 22: 1,
     / parameter-encryption-info / 19: h'D86...1F0'
   },
   / directive-copy / 22, 15

        Figure 4: Example showing the extended suit-directive-copy.

   The payload to be encrypted may be detached and, in that case, it is
   not covered by the digital signature or the MAC protecting the
   manifest.  (To be more precise, the suit-authentication-wrapper found
   in the envelope contains a digest of the manifest in the SUIT Digest
   Container.)

   The lack of authentication and integrity protection of the payload is
   particularly a concern when a cipher without integrity protection is
   used.

   To provide authentication and integrity protection of the payload in
   the detached payload case a SUIT Digest Container with the hash of
   the encrypted and/or plaintext payload MUST be included in the
   manifest.  See suit-parameter-image-digest parameter in
   Section 8.4.8.6 of [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest].

   Once a CEK is available, the steps described in Section 6.3 are
   applicable.  These steps apply to both content key distribution
   methods.

6.  Content Key Distribution

   The sub-sections below describe two content key distribution methods,
   namely AES Key Wrap (AES-KW) and Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman (ES-
   DH).  Many other methods are specified in the literature, and even
   supported by COSE.  New methods can be added via enhancements to this
   specification.  The two specified methods were selected to their
   maturity, different security properties, and to ensure
   interoperability in deployments.

   The two content key distribution methods require the CEKs to be
   randomly generated.  It must be ensured that the guidelines for
   random number generation in [RFC8937] are followed.

   When an encrypted payload is sent to multiple recipients, there are
   different deployment options.  To explain these options we use the
   following notation:

      - KEK(R1, S) refers to a KEK shared between recipient R1 and
        the sender S. The KEK, as a concept, is used by AES Key Wrap
        but not by ES-DH.
      - CEK(R1, S) refers to a CEK shared between R1 and S.
      - CEK(*, S) or KEK(*, S) are used when a single CEK or a single
        KEK is shared with all authorized recipients by a given sender
        S in a certain context.
      - ENC(plaintext, k) refers to the encryption of plaintext with
        a key k.

6.1.  Content Key Distribution with AES Key Wrap

6.1.1.  Introduction

   The AES Key Wrap (AES-KW) algorithm is described in [RFC3394], and
   can be used to encrypt a randomly generated content-encryption key
   (CEK) with a pre-shared key-encryption key (KEK).  The COSE
   conventions for using AES-KW are specified in Section 8.5.2 of
   [RFC9052] and in Section 6.2.1 of [RFC9053].  The encrypted CEK is
   carried in the COSE_recipient structure alongside the information
   needed for AES-KW.  The COSE_recipient structure, which is a
   substructure of the COSE_Encrypt structure, contains the CEK
   encrypted by the KEK.

   To provide high security for AES Key Wrap, it is important that the
   KEK is of high entropy, and that implementations protect the KEK from
   disclosure.  Compromise of the KEK may result in the disclosure of
   all data protected with that KEK, including binaries, and
   configuration data.

   The COSE_Encrypt structure conveys information for encrypting the
   payload, which includes information like the algorithm and the IV,
   even though the payload may not be embedded in the
   COSE_Encrypt.ciphertext if it is conveyed as detached content.

6.1.2.  Deployment Options

   There are three deployment options for use with AES Key Wrap for
   payload encryption:

   *  If all recipients (typically of the same product family) share the
      same KEK, a single COSE_recipient structure contains the encrypted
      CEK.  The sender executes the following steps:

        1. Fetch KEK(*, S)
        2. Generate CEK
        3. ENC(CEK, KEK)
        4. ENC(payload, CEK)

   This deployment option is stronly discouraged.  An attacker gaining
   access to the KEK will be able to encrypt and send payloads to all
   recipients configured to use this KEK.

   *  If recipients have different KEKs, then multiple COSE_recipient
      structures are included but only a single CEK is used.  Each
      COSE_recipient structure contains the CEK encrypted with the KEKs
      appropriate for a given recipient.  The benefit of this approach
      is that the payload is encrypted only once with a CEK while there
      is no sharing of the KEK across recipients.  Hence, authorized
      recipients still use their individual KEK to decrypt the CEK and
      to subsequently obtain the plaintext.  The steps taken by the
      sender are:

       1.  Generate CEK
       2.  for i=1 to n
           {
       2a.    Fetch KEK(Ri, S)
       2b.    ENC(CEK, KEK(Ri, S))
           }
       3.  ENC(payload, CEK)

   *  The third option is to use different CEKs encrypted with KEKs of
      authorized recipients.  This approach is appropriate when no
      benefits can be gained from encrypting and transmitting payloads
      only once.  Assume there are n recipients with their unique KEKs -
      KEK(R1, S), ..., KEK(Rn, S).  The sender needs to execute the
      following steps:

       1.  for i=1 to n
           {
       1a.    Fetch KEK(Ri, S)
       1b.    Generate CEK(Ri, S)
       1c.    ENC(CEK(Ri, S), KEK(Ri, S))
       1d.    ENC(payload, CEK(Ri, S))
       2.  }

6.1.3.  CDDL

   The CDDL for the COSE_Encrypt_Tagged structure is shown in Figure 5.
   empty_or_serialized_map and header_map are structures defined in
   [RFC9052].

outer_header_map_protected = empty_or_serialized_map
outer_header_map_unprotected = header_map

SUIT_Encryption_Info_AESKW = [
  protected   : bstr .cbor outer_header_map_protected,
  unprotected : outer_header_map_unprotected,
  ciphertext  : bstr / nil,
  recipients  : [ + COSE_recipient_AESKW .within COSE_recipient ]
]

COSE_recipient_AESKW = [
  protected   : bstr .size 0 / bstr .cbor empty_map,
  unprotected : recipient_header_unpr_map_aeskw,
  ciphertext  : bstr        ; CEK encrypted with KEK
]

empty_map = {}

recipient_header_unpr_map_aeskw =
{
    1 => int,         ; algorithm identifier
  ? 4 => bstr,        ; identifier of the KEK pre-shared with the recipient
  * label => values   ; extension point
}

       Figure 5: CDDL for AES-KW-based Content Key Distribution

   Note that the AES-KW algorithm, as defined in Section 2.2.3.1 of
   [RFC3394], does not have public parameters that vary on a per-
   invocation basis.  Hence, the protected header in the COSE_recipient
   structure is a byte string of zero length.

6.2.  Content Key Distribution with Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman

6.2.1.  Introduction

   Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman (ES-DH) is a scheme that provides
   public key encryption given a recipient's public key.  There are
   multiple variants of this scheme; this document re-uses the variant
   specified in Section 8.5.5 of [RFC9052].

   The following two layer structure is used:

   *  Layer 0: Has a content encrypted with the CEK.  The content may be
      detached.

   *  Layer 1: Uses the AES Key Wrap algorithm to encrypt the randomly
      generated CEK with the KEK derived with ES-DH, whereby the
      resulting symmetric key is fed into the HKDF-based key derivation
      function.

   As a result, the two layers combine ES-DH with AES-KW and HKDF.  An
   example is given in Figure 9.

6.2.2.  Deployment Options

   There are two deployment options with this approach.  We assume that
   recipients are always configured with a device-unique public /
   private key pair.

   *  A sender wants to transmit a payload to multiple recipients.  All
      recipients shall receive the same encrypted payload, i.e. the same
      CEK is used.  One COSE_recipient structure per recipient is used
      and it contains the CEK encrypted with the KEK.  To generate the
      KEK each COSE_recipient structure contains a COSE_recipient_inner
      structure to carry the sender's ephemeral key and an identifier
      for the recipients public key.

   The steps taken by the sender are:

       1.  Generate CEK
       2.  for i=1 to n
           {
       2a.     Generate KEK(Ri, S) using ES-DH
       2b.     ENC(CEK, KEK(Ri, S))
           }
       3.  ENC(payload,CEK)

   *  The alternative is to encrypt a payload with a different CEK for
      each recipient.  This results in n-manifests.  This approach is
      useful when payloads contain information unique to a device.  The
      encryption operation then effectively becomes ENC(payload_i,
      CEK(Ri, S)).  Assume that KEK(R1, S),..., KEK(Rn, S) have been
      generated for the different recipients using ES-DH.  The following
      steps need to be made by the sender:

       1.  for i=1 to n
           {
       1a.     Generate KEK(Ri, S) using ES-DH
       1b.     Generate CEK(Ri, S)
       1c.     ENC(CEK(Ri, S), KEK(Ri, S))
       1d.     ENC(payload, CEK(Ri, S))
           }

6.2.4.  Context Information Structure

   The context information structure is used to ensure that the derived
   keying material is "bound" to the context of the transaction.  This
   specification re-uses the structure defined in Section 5.2 of RFC
   9053 and tailors it accordingly.

   The following information elements are bound to the context:

   *  the protocol employing the key-derivation method,

   *  information about the utilized AES Key Wrap algorithm, and the key
      length.

   *  the protected header field, which contains the content key
      encryption algorithm.

   The sender and recipient identities are left empty.

   The following fields in Figure 8 require an explanation:

   *  The COSE_KDF_Context.AlgorithmID field MUST contain the algorithm
      identifier for AES Key Wrap algorithm utilized.  This
      specification uses the following values: A128KW (value -4), A192KW
      (value -4), or A256KW (value -5)

   *  The COSE_KDF_Context.SuppPubInfo.keyDataLength field MUST contain
      the key length of the algorithm in the
      COSE_KDF_Context.AlgorithmID field expressed as the number of
      bits.  For A128KW the value is 128, for A192KW the value is 192,
      and for A256KW the value 256.

   *  The COSE_KDF_Context.SuppPubInfo.other field captures the protocol
      in which the ES-DH content key distribution algorithm is used and
      MUST be set to the constant string "SUIT Payload Encryption".

   *  The COSE_KDF_Context.SuppPubInfo.protected field MUST contain the
      serialized content of the recipient_header_map_esdh field, which
      contains (among other fields) the identifier of the content key
      distribution method.

   The HKDF-based key derivation function MAY contain a salt value, as
   described in Section 5.1 of [RFC9053].  This optional value is used
   to influence the key generation process.  This specification does not
   mandate the use of a salt value.  If the salt is public and carried
   in the message, then the "salt" algorithm header parameter MUST be
   used.  The purpose of the salt is to provide extra randomness in the
   KDF context.  If the salt is sent in the 'salt' algorithm header
   parameter, then the receiver MUST be able to process the salt and
   MUST pass it into the key derivation function.  For more information
   about the salt, see [RFC5869] and NIST SP800-56 [SP800-56].

   Profiles of this specification MAY specify an extended version of the
   context information structure or MAY utilize a different context
   information structure.

   This section summarizes the steps taken for content encryption, which
   applies to both content key distribution methods.

   For use with AEAD ciphers, the COSE specification requires a
   consistent byte stream for the authenticated data structure to be
   created.  This structure is shown in Figure 10 and is defined in
   Section 5.3 of [RFC9052].

    Enc_structure = [
      context : "Encrypt",
      protected : empty_or_serialized_map,
      external_aad : bstr
    ]

              Figure 10: CDDL for Enc_structure Data Structure

   This Enc_structure needs to be populated as follows:

   The protected field in the Enc_structure from Figure 10 refers to the
   content of the protected field from the COSE_Encrypt structure.

   The value of the external_aad MUST be set to a zero-length byte
   string, i.e., h'' in diagnostic notation and encoded as 0x40.

   For use with ciphers that do not provide integrity protection, such
   as AES-CTR and AES-CBC (see [I-D.ietf-cose-aes-ctr-and-cbc]), the
   Enc_structure shown in Figure 10 MUST NOT be used because the
   Enc_structure represents the Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) byte
   string consumable only by AEAD ciphers.  Hence, the Additional
   Authenticated Data structure is not supplied to the API of the
   cipher.  The protected header in the SUIT_Encryption_Info_AESKW or
   SUIT_Encryption_Info_ESDH structure MUST be a zero-length byte
   string, respectively.

7.  Firmware Updates on IoT Devices with Flash Memory

   Note: This section is specific to firmware images and does not apply
   to generic software, configuration data, and machine learning models.

   Flash memory on microcontrollers is a type of non-volatile memory
   that erases data in units called blocks, pages, or sectors and re-
   writes data at the byte level (often 4-bytes) or larger units.  Flash
   memory is furthermore segmented into different memory regions, which
   store the bootloader, different versions of firmware images (in so-
   called slots), and configuration data.  Figure 11 shows an example
   layout of a microcontroller flash area.  The primary slot typically
   contains the firmware image to be executed by the bootloader, which
   is a common deployment on devices that do not offer the concept of
   position independent code.  Position independent code is not a
   feature frequently found in real-time operating systems used on
   microcontrollers.  There are many flavors of embedded devices, the
   market is large and fragmented.  Hence, it is likely that some
   implementations and deployments implement their firmware update
   procedure different than described below.  On a positive note, the
   SUIT manifest allows different deployment scenarios to be supported
   easily thanks to the "scripting" functionality offered by the
   commands.

   When the encrypted firmware image has been transferred to the device,
   it will typically be stored in a staging area, in the secondary slot
   in our example.

   At the next boot, the bootloader will recognize a new firmware image
   in the secondary slot and will start decrypting the downloaded image
   sector-by-sector and will swap it with the image found in the primary
   slot.

   The swap will only take place after the signature on the plaintext is
   verified.  Note that the plaintext firmware image is available in the
   primary slot only after the swap has been completed, unless "dummy
   decrypt" is used to compute the hash over the plaintext prior to
   executing the decrypt operation during a swap.  Dummy decryption here
   refers to the decryption of the firmware image found in the secondary
   slot sector-by-sector and computing a rolling hash over the resulting
   plaintext firmware image (also sector-by-sector) without performing
   the swap operation.  While there are performance optimizations
   possible, such as conveying hashes for each sector in the manifest
   rather than a hash of the entire firmware image, such optimizations
   are not described in this specification.

   This approach of swapping the newly downloaded image with the
   previously valid image requires two slots to allow the update to be
   reversed in case the newly obtained firmware image fails to boot.
   This approach adds robustness to the firmware update procedure.

   Since the image in primary slot is available in cleartext, it may
   need to be re-encrypted before copying it to the secondary slot.
   This may be necessary when the secondary slot has different access
   permissions or when the staging area is located in off-chip flash
   memory and is therefore more vulnerable to physical attacks.  Note
   that this description assumes that the processor does not execute
   encrypted memory by using on-the-fly decryption in hardware.

   The ability to restart an interrupted firmware update is often a
   requirement for low-end IoT devices.  To fulfill this requirement it
   is necessary to chunk a firmware image into sectors and to encrypt
   each sector individually using a cipher that does not increase the
   size of the resulting ciphertext (i.e., by not adding an
   authentication tag after each encrypted block).

   When an update gets aborted while the bootloader is decrypting the
   newly obtained image and swapping the sectors, the bootloader can
   restart where it left off.  This technique offers robustness and
   better performance.

   For this purpose, ciphers without integrity protection are used to
   encrypt the firmware image.  Integrity protection of the firmware
   image MUST be provided and the suit-parameter-image-digest, defined
   in Section 8.4.8.6 of [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest], MUST be used.

   [I-D.ietf-cose-aes-ctr-and-cbc] registers AES Counter (AES-CTR) mode
   and AES Cipher Block Chaining (AES-CBC) ciphers that do not offer
   integrity protection.  These ciphers are useful for use cases that
   require firmware encryption on IoT devices.  For many other use cases
   where software packages, configuration information or personalization
   data need to be encrypted, the use of Authenticated Encryption with
   Associated Data (AEAD) ciphers is RECOMMENDED.

   The following sub-sections provide further information about the
   initialization vector (IV) selection for use with AES-CBC and AES-CTR
   in the firmware encryption context.  An IV MUST NOT be re-used when
   the same key is used.  For this application, the IVs are not random
   but rather based on the slot/sector-combination in flash memory.  The
   text below assumes that the block-size of AES is (much) smaller than
   the sector size.  The typical sector-size of flash memory is in the
   order of KiB.  Hence, multiple AES blocks need to be decrypted until
   an entire sector is completed.

7.1.  AES-CBC

   In AES-CBC, a single IV is used for encryption of firmware belonging
   to a single sector, since individual AES blocks are chained together,
   as shown in Figure 12.  The numbering of sectors in a slot MUST start
   with zero (0) and MUST increase by one with every sector till the end
   of the slot is reached.  The IV follows this numbering.

   For example, let us assume the slot size of a specific flash
   controller on an IoT device is 64 KiB, the sector size 4096 bytes (4
   KiB) and AES-128-CBC uses an AES-block size of 128 bit (16 bytes).
   Hence, sector 0 needs 4096/16=256 AES-128-CBC operations using IV 0.
   If the firmware image fills the entire slot, then that slot contains
   16 sectors, i.e. IVs ranging from 0 to 15.

                        Figure 12: AES-CBC Operation

7.2.  AES-CTR

   Unlike AES-CBC, AES-CTR uses an IV per AES operation, as shown in
   Figure 13.  Hence, when an image is encrypted using AES-CTR-128 or
   AES-CTR-256, the IV MUST start with zero (0) and MUST be incremented
   by one for each 16-byte plaintext block within the entire slot.

   Using the previous example with a slot size of 64 KiB, the sector
   size 4096 bytes and the AES plaintext block size of 16 byte requires
   IVs from 0 to 255 in the first sector and 16 * 256 IVs for the
   remaining sectors in the slot.

7.3.  Battery Exhaustion Attacks

   The use of flash memory opens up for another attack.  An attacker may
   swap detached payloads and thereby force the device to process a
   wrong payload.  While this attack will be detected, a device may have
   performed energy-expensive flash operations already.  These
   operations may reduce the lifetime of devices when they are battery
   powered Iot devices.  See Section 7 for further discussion about IoT
   devices using flash memory.

   Including the digest of the encrypted payload allows the device to
   detect a battery exhaustion attack before energy consuming decryption
   and flash operations took place.  Including the digest of the
   plaintext payload is adequate when battery exhaustion attacks are not
   a concern.

   and its encryption info to devices.

8.3.  Operational Considerations

   The algorithms described in this document assume that the party
   performing payload encryption

   *  shares a key-encryption key (KEK) with the recipient (for use with
      the AES Key Wrap scheme), or

   *  is in possession of the public key of the recipient (for use with
      ES-DH).

   Both cases require some upfront communication interaction to
   distribute these keys to the involved communication parties.  This
   interaction may be provided by a device management protocol, as
   described in [RFC9019], or may be executed earlier in the lifecycle
   of the device, for example during manufacturing or during
   commissioning.  In addition to the keying material key identifiers
   and algorithm information need to be provisioned.  This specification
   places no requirements on the structure of the key identifier.

   In some cases third party companies analyse binaries for known
   security vulnerabilities.  With encrypted payloads, this type of
   analysis is prevented.  Consequently, these third party companies
   either need to be given access to the plaintext binary before
   encryption or they need to become authorized recipients of the
   encrypted payloads.  In either case, it is necessary to explicitly
   consider those third parties in the software supply chain when such a
   binary analysis is desired.

9.  Security Considerations

   This entire document is about security.

Internet-Draft    Encrypted Payloads in SUIT Manifests    September 2023


   Note that it is good security practise to use different long-term
   keys for different purpose.  For example, the KEK used with an AES-
   KW-based content key distribution method for encryption should be
   different from the long-term symmetric key used for authentication
   and integrity protection when uses with COSE_Mac0.

   The design of this specification allows to use different long-term
   keys for encrypting payloads.  For example, KEK_1 may be used with an
   AES-KW content key distribution method to encrypt a firmware image
   while KEK_2 would be used to encrypt configuration data.  This
   approach reduces the attack surface since permissions of authors to
   these long-term keys may vary based on their privileges.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to add the following value to the SUIT Parameters
   registry established by Section 11.5 of [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest]:

   Label      Name                 Reference
