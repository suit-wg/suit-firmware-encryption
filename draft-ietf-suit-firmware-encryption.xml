    <abstract>


<t>This document specifies techniques for encrypting software, firmware 
and personalization data by utilizing the IETF 
SUIT manifest. Key agreement is provided by ephemeral-static (ES)
Diffie-Hellman (DH) and AES Key Wrap (AES-KW). ES-DH
uses public key cryptography while AES-KW uses a pre-shared 
key-encryption key. Encryption of the plaintext is 
accomplished with conventional symmetric key cryptography.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the
need for a reliable and secure firmware update mechanism that is also
suitable for constrained devices. To protect firmware images the SUIT manifest
format was developed <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>. The SUIT manifest provides a 
bundle of metadata about the firmware for an IoT device, where to find 
the firmware image, and the devices to which it applies.</t>

<t>The SUIT information model <xref target="RFC9124"/> details the
information that has to be offered by the SUIT manifest format. In addition to
offering protection against modification, which is provided by a digital
signature or a message authentication code, the firmware image may also 
be afforded confidentiality using encryption.</t>

<t>Encryption prevents third parties, including attackers, from gaining access to
the firmware binary. Hackers typically need intimate knowledge of the target 
firmware to mount their attacks. For example, return-oriented programming (ROP)
<xref target="ROP"/> requires access to the binary and encryption makes it much more difficult
to write exploits.</t>

<t>The SUIT manifest provides the data needed for authorized recipients 
of the firmware image to decrypt it. The firmware image is encrypted using a 
symmetric key.</t>

<t>A symmetric key can be established using a variety of mechanisms; this document 
defines two approaches for use with the IETF SUIT manifest, namely:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Ephemeral-Static (ES) Diffie-Hellman (DH), and</t>
  <t>AES Key Wrap (AES-KW) using a pre-shared key-encryption key (KEK).</t>
</list></t>

<t>OPEN ISSUE: Should KEM algorithms also be supported?</t>

<t>These choices reduce the number of possible key establishment options and thereby 
help increase interoperability between different SUIT manifest parser implementations.</t>

<t>While the original motivating use case of this document was firmware encryption, SUIT manifests
may require payloads other than firmware images to experience confidentiality
protection, such as
- software packages,
- personalization data, 
- configuration data, and
- machine learning models.</t>

<t>Hence, the term payload is used to generically refer to those objects that may be subject to 
encryption.</t>

<section anchor="conventions-and-terminology"><name>Conventions and Terminology</name>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/>
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

<t>This document assumes familiarity with the IETF SUIT manifest <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>, 
the SUIT information model <xref target="RFC9124"/> and the SUIT architecture <xref target="RFC9019"/>.</t>

<t>The terms sender and recipient have the following meaning:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Sender: Role of the entity that sends an encrypted payload.</t>
  <t>Recipient: Role of the entity that receives an encrypted payload.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Additionally, the following abbreviations are used in this document:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Key Wrap (KW), defined in <xref target="RFC3394"/> (for use with AES)</t>
  <t>Key-Encryption Key (KEK) <xref target="RFC3394"/></t>
  <t>Content-Encryption Key (CEK) <xref target="RFC5652"/></t>
  <t>Ephemeral-Static (ES) Diffie-Hellman (DH) <xref target="RFC9052"/></t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="arch"><name>Architecture</name>

<t><xref target="RFC9019"/> describes the architecture for distributing payloads and
manifests from an author to devices. It does, however, not detail the
use of payload encryption.</t>

<t>This document enhances this architecture to support encryption. The author
and the distribution system are logical roles. In some deployments these
roles are separated in different physical entities and in others they are
co-located.</t>

<t><xref target="arch-fig"/> shows the distribution system, which represents the firmware
server and the device management infrastructure. The distribution system is
aware of the individual devices to which a payload has to be delivered. The
author is typically unaware which devices need to receive these payloads.</t>

<t>To apply encryption the sender needs to know the recipient. For AES-KW the
KEK needs to be known and, in case of ES-DH, the sender needs to be in possession
of the public key of the recipient. The DH public key and parameters may be in
the recipient's X.509 certificate <xref target="RFC5280"/>.</t>

<t>If the author delegates the task of identifying the recipients of the payloads
to the distribution system, it needs to trust it with the appropriate
protection of the plaintext firmware image before encryption is performed.</t>

<t>To offer confidentiality protection two deployment variants need to be
supported:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The author, as the sender, transmits the encrypted payload to a single
device, or to multiple devices. The device(s) perform decryption and
act as recipients.</t>
  <t>The author treats the distribution system as the initial recipient. Then,
the distribution system decrypts and re-encrypts the payload for consumption
by the device (or the devices). Delegating the task of re-encrypting
the payload to the distribution system offers flexiblity when the number
of devices that need to receive encrypted payloads changes dynamically
or when updates to KEKs or recipient public keys are necessary. As a downside,
the author needs to trust the distribution system with performing the
re-encryption of the payload.</t>
</list></t>

<t>For both variants the key distribution data, which is embedded inside the
COSE_Encrypt structure, is included in the SUIT manifest.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="parameters"><name>New Extensions</name>

<t>This specification introduces two extensions to the SUIT_Parameters structure.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A SUIT encryption info parameter (called suit-parameter-encryption-info),
see <xref target="parameter-fig"/>, which contains key distribution information. It is carried
within the suit-directive-override-parameters or the suit-directive-set-parameters
structure. The content of the SUIT_Encryption_Info structure is explained in 
<xref target="AES-KW"/> (for AES-KW) and <xref target="ES-DH"/> (for ECDH-ES). An implementation claiming
conformance with this specification must implement support for this parameter.
A device may, however, support only one of the available key distribution techniques.</t>
  <t>A CEK verification parameter (called suit-parameter-cek-verification), see
<xref target="parameter-fig"/>, is utilized in environments where battery exhaustion attacks
are a concern. Details about the CEK verification can be found in 
<xref target="cek-verification"/>. This parameter is optional to implement and use.</t>

<section anchor="content-key-distribution-methods"><name>Content Key Distribution Methods</name>

<t>The sub-sections below describe two content key distribution mechanisms,
namely AES Key Wrap (AES-KW) and Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman (ES-DH).
Other mechanisms are supported by COSE and may be supported via enhancements
to this specification.</t>

<t>When an encrypted firmware image is sent to multiple recipients, there
are different deployment options. To explain these options we use the
following notation:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>KEK(R1,S) refers to a KEK shared between recipient R1 and the sender S.
The KEK, as a concept, is used by AES Key Wrap.</t>
  <t>CEK(R1,S) refers to a CEK shared between R1 and S.</t>
  <t>CEK(<em>,S) or KEK(</em>,S) are used when a single CEK or a single KEK is shared
with all authorized recipients by a given sender S in a certain context.</t>
  <t>ENC(plaintext, k) refers to the encryption of plaintext with a key k.</t>
  <t>KEK_i or CEK_i refers to the i-th instance of the KEK or CEK, respectively.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="AES-KW"><name>Content Key Distribution with AES Key Wrap</name>

<section anchor="introduction-1"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>The AES Key Wrap (AES-KW) algorithm is described in RFC 3394 <xref target="RFC3394"/>, and
can be used to encrypt a randomly generated content-encryption key (CEK)
with a pre-shared key-encryption key (KEK). The COSE conventions for using
AES-KW are specified in Section 8.5.2 of <xref target="RFC9052"/> and in Section 6.2.1 of 
<xref target="RFC9053"/>. The encrypted CEK is carried in the COSE_recipient structure
alongside the information needed for AES-KW. The COSE_recipient structure,
which is a substructure of the COSE_Encrypt structure, contains the CEK 
encrypted by the KEK.</t>

<t>The COSE_Encrypt structure conveys information for encrypting the payload, which 
includes information like the algorithm and the IV, even though the payload 
is not embedded in the COSE_Encrypt.ciphertext itself since it conveyed as detached content.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="deployment-options"><name>Deployment Options</name>

<t>There are three deployment options for use with AES Key Wrap for payload
encryption:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>If all authorized recipients have access to the KEK, a single 
COSE_recipient structure contains the encrypted CEK. The sender executes
the following steps:</t>
</list></t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      Fetch KEK(*,S)
      Generate CEK
      ENC(CEK,KEK)
      ENC(payload,CEK)
]]></artwork></figure>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>If recipients have different KEKs, then multiple COSE_recipient structures 
are included but only a single CEK is used. Each COSE_recipient structure 
contains the CEK encrypted with the KEKs appropriate for a given recipient.
The benefit of this approach is that the payload is encrypted only once with 
a CEK while there is no sharing of the KEK across recipients. Hence, authorized 
recipients still use their individual KEK to decrypt the CEK and to subsequently
obtain the plaintext. The steps taken by the sender are:</t>
</list></t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      Generate CEK
      for i=1 to n {
         Fetch KEK_i(Ri, S)
         ENC(CEK, KEK_i)
      }
      ENC(payload,CEK)
]]></artwork></figure>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The third option is to use different CEKs encrypted with KEKs of 
authorized recipients. Assume there are n recipients with their unique KEKs - 
KEK_1(R1, S),..., KEK_n(Rn, S). The sender needs to make the following steps:</t>
</list></t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      for i=1 to n {
         Fetch KEK_i(Ri, S)
         Generate CEK_i
         ENC(CEK_i, KEK_i)
         ENC(payload,CEK_i)
      }
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>This approach is appropriate when no benefits can be gained
from encrypting and transmitting payloads only once.</t>

<t>Note that the AES-KW algorithm, as defined in Section 2.2.3.1 of <xref target="RFC3394"/>,

<section anchor="ES-DH"><name>Content Key Distribution with Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman</name>

<section anchor="introduction-2"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman (ES-DH) is a scheme that provides public key
encryption given a recipient's public key. There are multiple variants
of this scheme; this document re-uses the variant specified in Section 8.5.5 
of <xref target="RFC9052"/>.</t>

<t>The following three layer structure is used:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Layer 0: Has a content encrypted with the CEK. The content may be detached.</t>
  <t>Layer 1: Uses the AES Key Wrap algorithm to encrypt a randomly generated
CEK with the KEK derived by layer 2.</t>
  <t>Layer 2: Uses ECDH Ephemeral-Static direct to generate the KEK for layer 1.</t>
</list></t>

<t>As a result, the three layers combine ECDH-ES with AES-KW. An example is
given in Appendix B of RFC 9052 and in <xref target="esdh-example"/>.</t>

<t>While the SUIT manifest is integrity protected and authenticated, the SUIT envelope 
is not protected cryptographically. Hence, an adversary located along the communication
path between the sender and the recipient could modify the COSE_Encrypt structure
(assuming that no other communication security mechanism is in use).</t>

<t>For example, if the attacker alters the key distribution data then a recipient will
decrypt the firmware image with an incorrect key. This will lead to expending 
energy and flash cycles until the failure is detected.</t>

<t>To mitigate this attack, a new parameter, called suit-cek-verification, is added
to the manifest. The suit-cek-verification parameter is optional to implement and 
optional to use. When used, it reduces the risk of a battery exhaustion attack against 
the IoT device.</t>

<t>Since the manifest is protected by a digital signature or a MAC, an adversary cannot 
successfully modify this value. This parameter allows the recipient to verify 
whether the CEK has successfully been derived.</t>

<t>The suit-cek-verification parameter contains a byte string resulting from the 
encryption of 8 bytes of 0xA5 using the CEK with a nonce of all zeros and empty 
additional data using the cipher algorithm and mode also used to encrypt the
plaintext. The same nonce used for CEK verification MUST NOT be used to 
encrypt plaintext with the same CEK.</t>

<section anchor="firmware-updates-on-iot-devices-with-flash-memory"><name>Firmware Updates on IoT Devices with Flash Memory.</name>

<t>Flash memory on microcontrollers is a type of non-volatile memory that erases
data in units called blocks, pages or sectors and re-writes data at byte level 
(often 4-bytes).
Flash memory is furthermore segmented into different memory regions, which store
the bootloader, different versions of firmware images (in so-called slots), 
and configuration data. <xref target="image-layout"/> shows an example layout of a 
microcontroller flash area. The primary slot contains the firmware image to be 
executed by the bootloader, which is a common deployment on devices that do 
not offer the concept of position independent code.</t>

<t>When the encrypted firmware image has been transferred to the device, it will
typically be stored in a staging area, in the secondary slot in our example.</t>

<t>At the next boot, the bootloader will recognize a new firmware image in the 
secondary slot and will start decrypting the downloaded image sector-by-sector
and will swap it with the image found in the primary slot.</t>

<t>The swap should only take place after the signature on the plaintext is verified.
Note that the plaintext firmware image is available in the primary slot only after
the swap has been completed, unless "dummy decrypt" is used to compute the hash 
over the plaintext prior to executing the decrypt operation during a swap.
Dummy decryption here refers to the decryption of the firmware image found in 
the secondary slot sector-by-sector and computing a rolling hash over the resulting
plaintext firmware image (also sector-by-sector) without performing the swap operation. 
While there are performance optimizations possible, such as conveying hashes for 
each sector in the manifest rather than a hash of the entire firmware image, 
such optimizations are not described in this specification.</t>

<t>This approach of swapping the newly downloaded image with the previously valid 
image is often referred as A/B approach. A/B refers to the two slots involved.
Two slots are used to allow the update to be reversed in case the newly obtained
firmware image fails to boot. This approach adds robustness to the firmware 
update procedure.</t>

<t>Since the image in primary slot is available in cleartext it may need to 
re-encrypted it before copying it to the secondary slot. This may be necessary
when the secondary slot has different access permissions or when the staging
area is located in an off-chip flash memory and therefore more vulnerable to
physical attacks. Note that this description assumes that the processor does
not execute encrypted memory (i.e. using on-the-fly decryption in hardware).</t>

<t>The ability to restart an interrupted firmware update is often a requirement
for low-end IoT devices. To fulfill this requirement it is necessary to chunk
a firmware image into sectors and to encrypt each sector individually
using a cipher that does not increase the size of the resulting ciphertext 
(i.e., by not adding an authentication tag after each encrypted block).</t>

<t>When an update gets aborted while the bootloader is decrypting the newly obtained
image and swapping the sectors, the bootloader can restart where it left off. This
technique offers robustness and better performance.</t>

<t>For this purpose ciphers without integrity protection are used
to encrypt the firmware image. Integrity protection for the firmware image must,
however, be provided and the suit-parameter-image-digest, defined in Section 
8.4.8.6 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>, MUST be used.</t>

<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-aes-ctr-and-cbc"/> registers AES Counter mode (AES-CTR) and 
AES Cipher Block Chaining (AES-CBC) ciphers that do not offer integrity protection. 
These ciphers are useful for the use cases that require firmware encryption on IoT
devices. For many other use cases where software packages, configuration information 
or personalization data needs to be encrypted, the use of Authenticated Encryption 
with Additional Data (AEAD) ciphers is preferred.</t>

<t>The following sub-sections provide further information about the initialization vector
(IV) selection for use with AES-CBC and AES-CTR in the firmware encryption context. An
IV MUST NOTE be re-used when the same key is used. For this application, the IVs are
not random but rather based on the slot/sector-combination in flash memory. The 
text below assumes that the block-size of AES is (much) smaller than sector size. The
typical sector-size of flash memory is in the order of KiB. Hence, multiple AES blocks
need to be decrypted until an entire sector is completed.</t>

<section anchor="aes-cbc"><name>AES-CBC</name>

<t>In AES-CBC a single IV is used for encryption of firmware belonging to a single sector
since individual AES blocks are chained toghether, as shown in <xref target="aes-cbc-fig"/>. The numbering 
of sectors in a slot MUST start with zero (0) and MUST increase by one with every sector
till the end of the slot is reached. The IV follows this numbering.</t>

<t>For example, let us assume the slot size of a specific flash controller on an IoT device 
is 64 KiB, the sector size 4096 bytes (4 KiB) and AES-128-CBC uses an AES-block size of
128 bit (16 bytes). Hence, sector 0 needs 4096/16=256 AES-128-CBC operations using IV 0.
If the firmware image fills the entire slot then that slot contains 16 sectors, i.e. IVs
ranging from 0 to 15.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="aes-ctr"><name>AES-CTR</name>

<t>Unlike AES-CBC, AES-CTR uses an IV per AES operation, as shown in <xref target="aes-ctr-fig"/>. 
Hence, when an image is encrypted using AES-CTR-128 or AES-CTR-256, the IV MUST
start with zero (0) and MUST be incremented by one for each 16-byte plaintext block
within the entire slot.</t>

<t>Using the previous example with a slot size of 64 KiB, the sector size 4096 bytes and
the AES plaintext block size of 16 byte requires IVs from 0 to 255 in the first sector
and 16 * 256 IVs for the remaining sectors in the slot. The last IV used to encrypt 
data in the slot is therefore</t>

<section anchor="sec-cons"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<t>The algorithms described in this document assume that the party performing payload encryption</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>shares a key-encryption key (KEK) with the recipient (for use with the AES Key Wrap scheme), or</t>
  <t>is in possession of the public key of the recipient (for use with ECDH-ES).</t>
</list></t>

<t>Both cases require some upfront communication interaction. This interaction is likely provided by
an IoT device management solution, as described in <xref target="RFC9019"/>.</t>

<t>For AES Key Wrap to provide high security it is important that the KEK is of high entropy, 
and that implementations protect the KEK from disclosure. Compromise of the KEK may result 
in the disclosure of all key data protected with that KEK.</t>

<t>Since the CEK is randomly generated, it must be ensured that the guidelines for random number 
generation in <xref target="RFC8937"/> are followed.</t>

<t>In some cases third party companies analyse binaries for known security vulnerabilities. With 
encrypted payloads this type of analysis is prevented. Consequently, these third party 
companies either need to be given access to the plaintext binary before encryption or they need 
to become authorized recipients of the encrypted payloads. In either case, it is necessary to 
explicitly consider those third parties in the software supply chain when such a binary analysis
is desired.</t>

	 <t>   This specification describes the format of a manifest.  A manifest is
   a bundle of metadata about code/data obtained by a recipient (chiefly
   the firmware for an IoT device), where to find the that code/data,
   the devices to which it applies, and cryptographic information
   protecting the manifest.  Software updates and Trusted Invocation
   both tend to use sequences of common operations, so the manifest
   encodes those sequences of operations, rather than declaring the
   metadata.
