    <abstract>


<t>This document specifies techniques for encrypting software, firmware 
and personalization data by utilizing the IETF 
SUIT manifest. Key agreement is provided by ephemeral-static (ES)
Diffie-Hellman (DH) and AES Key Wrap (AES-KW). ES-DH
uses public key cryptography while AES-KW uses a pre-shared 
key-encryption key. Encryption of the plaintext is 
accomplished with conventional symmetric key cryptography.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the
need for a reliable and secure firmware update mechanism that is also
suitable for constrained devices. To protect firmware images the SUIT manifest
format was developed <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>. The SUIT manifest provides a 
bundle of metadata about the firmware for an IoT device, where to find 
the firmware image, and the devices to which it applies.</t>

<t>The SUIT information model <xref target="RFC9124"/> details the
information that has to be offered by the SUIT manifest format. In addition to
offering protection against modification, which is provided by a digital
signature or a message authentication code, the firmware image may also 
be afforded confidentiality using encryption.</t>

<t>Encryption prevents third parties, including attackers, from gaining access to
the firmware binary. Hackers typically need intimate knowledge of the target 
firmware to mount their attacks. For example, return-oriented programming (ROP)
requires access to the binary and encryption makes it much more difficult to write 
exploits.</t>

<t>The SUIT manifest provides the data needed for authorized recipients 
of the firmware image to decrypt it. The firmware image is encrypted using a 
symmetric key.</t>

<t>A symmetric key can be established using a variety of mechanisms; this document 
defines two approaches for use with the IETF SUIT manifest, namely:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Ephemeral-Static (ES) Diffie-Hellman (DH), and</t>
  <t>AES Key Wrap (AES-KW) using a pre-shared key-encryption key (KEK).</t>
</list></t>

<t>These choices reduce the number of possible key establishment options and thereby 
help increase interoperability between different SUIT manifest parser implementations.</t>

<t>While the original motivating use case of this document was firmware encryption, SUIT manifests
may require payloads other than firmware images to experience confidentiality
protection, such as
- software (other than firmware),
- personalization data, 
- configuration data,
- machine learning models, etc.</t>

<t>Hence, the term payload is used to generically refer to those objects that may be subject to 
encryption.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="conventions-and-terminology"><name>Conventions and Terminology</name>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/>
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

<t>This document assumes familiarity with the IETF SUIT manifest <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>, 
the SUIT information model <xref target="RFC9124"/> and the SUIT architecture <xref target="RFC9019"/>.</t>

<t>The terms sender and recipient have the following meaning:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Sender: Role of the entity that sends an encrypted payload.</t>
  <t>Recipient: Role of the entity that receives an encrypted payload.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Additionally, the following abbreviations are used in this document:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Key Wrap (KW), defined in <xref target="RFC3394"/> (for use with AES)</t>
  <t>Key-Encryption Key (KEK) <xref target="RFC3394"/></t>
  <t>Content-Encryption Key (CEK) <xref target="RFC2630"/></t>
  <t>Ephemeral-Static (ES) Diffie-Hellman (DH) <xref target="RFC9052"/></t>

<section anchor="arch"><name>Architecture</name>

<t><xref target="RFC9019"/> describes the architecture for distributing payloads 
and manifests from an author to devices. It does, however, not
detail the use of payload encryption.</t>

<t>This document enhances this architecture to support encryption.
The author and the distribution system are logical roles. In some deployments
these roles are separated in different physical entities and in others
they are co-located.</t>

<t><xref target="arch-fig"/> shows the distribution system, which represents the firmware server 
and the device management infrastructure. The distribution system is aware 
of the individual devices to which a payload has to be delivered. The author
is typically unaware which devices need to receive these payloads.</t>

<t>To apply encryption the sender needs to know the recipient. For AES-KW the 
KEK needs to be known and, in case of ES-DH, the sender needs to be in possession 
of the public key of the recipient.</t>

<t>If the author delegates the task of identifying devices that are the recipients 
of the payloads to the distribution system, it needs to trust the delivery 
system to perform the encryption of the plaintext firmware image.</t>

<t>To offer confidentiality protection two deployment variants need to be 
supported:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The author acts as the sender and the recipient is the device
(or the devices).</t>
  <t>The author treats the distribution system as the initial recipient. Then, 
the distribution system decrypts and re-encrypts the payload for consumption 
by the device (or devices). Delegating the task of re-encrypting 
the payload to the distribution system offers flexiblity when the number 
of devices that need to receive encrypted payloads changes dynamically 
or when updates to KEKs or recipient public keys are necessary. As a downside, 
the author needs to trust the distribution system with performing the re-encryption 
of the payload.</t>
</list></t>

<t>For both variants the key distribution data (embedded inside the
COSE_Encrypt structure) is included in the SUIT envelope rather than in the SUIT 
manifest since the manifest will be digitally signed (or MACed) by the author.</t>

<t>Details about the changes to the envelope and the manifest can be found in the next 
section.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="suit-envelope-and-suit-manifest"><name>SUIT Envelope and SUIT Manifest</name>

<t>This specification introduces two extensions to the SUIT_Parameters,
as motivated in <xref target="arch"/>.</t>

<t>The SUIT manifest is enhanced with a key exchange payload, which is carried within
the suit-directive-override-parameters or suit-directive-set-parameters for each
encrypted payload. One SUIT_Encryption_Info is carried with
suit-parameter-encryption-info, see <xref target="parameter-fig"/>.
The content of the SUIT_Encryption_Info is explained in 
<xref target="AES-KW"/> (for AES-KW) and <xref target="RFC9052"/> (for ECDH-ES). When the encryption capability 
is used, the SUIT_Encryption_Info parameter MUST be included in the SUIT_Directive.</t>

<t>A CEK verification parameter (called suit-parameter-cek-verification),
see <xref target="parameter-fig"/>, also extends the manifest. This parameter is optional 
and is utilized in environments where battery exhaustion attacks are a 
concern. Details about the CEK verification can be found in 
<xref target="cek-verification"/>.</t>

<section anchor="AES-KW"><name>AES Key Wrap</name>

<t>The AES Key Wrap (AES-KW) algorithm is described in RFC 3394 <xref target="RFC3394"/>, and
it can be used to encrypt a randomly generated content-encryption key (CEK)
with a pre-shared key-encryption key (KEK). The COSE conventions for using
AES-KW are specified in Section 8.5.2 of <xref target="RFC9052"/> and in Section 6.2.1 of 
<xref target="RFC9053"/>.  The encrypted CEK is carried in the COSE_recipient structure
alongside the information needed for AES-KW. The COSE_recipient structure,
which is a substructure of the COSE_Encrypt structure, contains the CEK 
encrypted by the KEK.</t>

<t>When the firmware image is encrypted for use by multiple recipients, there 
are three options. We use the following notation KEK(R1,S) is the KEK shared 
between recipient R1 and the sender S. Likewise, CEK(R1,S) is shared between
R1 and S. If a single CEK or a single KEK is shared with all authorized 
recipients R by a given sender S in a certain context then we use CEK(<em>,S) 
or KEK(</em>,S), respectively. The notation ENC(plaintext, key) refers to the
encryption of plaintext with a given key.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>If all authorized recipients have access to the KEK, a single 
COSE_recipient structure contains the encrypted CEK. This means KEK(*,S) 
ENC(CEK,KEK), and ENC(payload,CEK).</t>
  <t>If recipients have different KEKs, then multiple COSE_recipient structures 
are included but only a single CEK is used. Each COSE_recipient structure 
contains the CEK encrypted with the KEKs appropriate for the recipient. In short, 
KEK_1(R1, S),..., KEK_n(Rn, S), ENC(CEK, KEK_i) for i=1 to n, and ENC(firmware,CEK). 
The benefit of this approach is that the payload is encrypted only once with 
a CEK while there is no sharing of the KEK across recipients. Hence, authorized 
recipients still use their individual KEKs to decrypt the CEK and to subsequently
obtain the plaintext.</t>
  <t>The third option is to use different CEKs encrypted with KEKs of the 
authorized recipients. Assume there are KEK_1(R1, S),..., KEK_n(Rn, S), and 
for i=1 to n the following computations need to be made: ENC(CEK_i, KEK_i) and 
ENC(firmware,CEK_i). This approach is appropriate when no benefits can be gained
from encrypting and transmitting payloads only once. For example, 
payloads may contain information unique to an instance of a device rather than
information that is independent of a device instance and therefore applies to an 
entire class of devices.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Note that the AES-KW algorithm, as defined in Section 2.2.3.1 of <xref target="RFC3394"/>, 
does not have public parameters that vary on a per-invocation basis. Hence, 
the protected structure in the COSE_recipient is a byte string of zero length.</t>

<t>The COSE_Encrypt conveys information for encrypting the payload, which 
includes information like the algorithm and the IV, even though the payload 
is not embedded in the COSE_Encrypt.ciphertext itself since it conveyed as detached content.</t>

<t>The CDDL for the COSE_Encrypt_Tagged structure is shown in <xref target="cddl-aeskw"/>.</t>

<t>The COSE specification requires a consistent byte stream for the

<t>As shown in <xref target="cddl-aeskw"/>, there are two protected fields: one 
protected field in the COSE_Encrypt structure and a second one in
the COSE_recipient structure. The 'protected' field in the Enc_structure,

<section anchor="ESDH"><name>Ephemeral-Static (ES) Diffie-Hellman (DH)</name>

<t>ES-DH, see <xref target="RFC9052"/>, is a scheme that provides public key
encryption given a recipient's public key.</t>

<t>The following three layer structure is used:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Layer 0: Has a content encrypted with the CEK. The content may be detached.</t>
  <t>Layer 1: Uses the AES Key Wrap algorithm to encrypt a randomly generated
CEK with the KEK derived by layer 2.</t>
  <t>Layer 2: Uses ECDH Ephemeral-Static direct to generate the KEK for layer 1.</t>
</list></t>

<t>As a result, the three layers combine ECDH-ES with AES-KW. An example is
given in Appendix B of RFC 9052.</t>

<t>This approach allows all recipients to use the same CEK to decrypt the 
firmware image, in case there are multiple recipients, to fulfill a requirement for 
the efficient distribution of firmware images using a multicast or broadcast 
distribution protocol.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="cek-verification"><name>CEK Verification</name>

<t>While the SUIT manifest is integrity protected and authenticated, the SUIT envelope 
is not protected cryptographically. Hence, an adversary located along the communication
path between the sender and the recipient could modify the COSE_Encrypt structure
(assuming that no other communication security mechanism is in use).</t>

<t>For example, if the attacker alters the key distribution data then a recipient will
decrypt the firmware image with an incorrect key. This will lead to expending 
energy and flash cycles until the failure is detected.</t>

<t>To mitigate this attack, a new parameter, called suit-cek-verification, is added
to the manifest. The suit-cek-verification parameter is optional to implement and 
optional to use. When used, it reduces the risk of a battery exhaustion attack against 
the IoT device.</t>

<t>Since the manifest is protected by a digital signature (or a MAC), an adversary cannot 
successfully modify this value. This parameter allows the recipient to verify 
whether the CEK has successfully been derived.</t>

<t>The suit-cek-verification parameter contains a byte string resulting from the 
encryption of 8 bytes of 0xA5 using the CEK with a nonce of all zeros and empty 
additional data using the cipher algorithm and mode also used to encrypt the
plaintext. The same nonce used for CEK verification MUST NOT be used to 
encrypt plaintext with the same CEK.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="firmware-updates-on-iot-devices-with-flash-memory"><name>Firmware Updates on IoT Devices with Flash Memory.</name>

<t>Flash memory on microcontrollers is a type of non-volatile memory that erases
data in units called blocks, pages or sectors and re-writes data at byte level 
(often 4-bytes).
Flash memory is furthermore segmented into different memory regions, which store
the bootloader, different versions of firmware images (in so-called slots), 
and configuration data. <xref target="image-layout"/> shows an example layout of a 
microcontroller flash area. The primary slot contains the firmware image to be 
executed by the bootloader, which is a common deployment on devices that do 
not offer the concept of position independent code.</t>

<t>When the encrypted firmware image has been transferred to the device, it will
typically be stored in a staging area, in the secondary slot in our example.</t>

<t>At the next boot, the bootloader will recognize a new firmware image in the 
secondary slot and will start decrypting the downloaded image sector-by-sector
and will swap it with the image found in the primary slot.</t>

<t>The swap should only take place after the signature on the plaintext is verified.
Note that the plaintext firmware image is available in the primary slot only after
the swap has been completed, unless "dummy decrypt" is used to compute the hash 
over the plaintext prior to executing the decrypt operation during a swap.
Dummy decryption here refers to the decryption of the firmware image found in 
the secondary slot sector-by-sector and computing a rolling hash over the resulting
plaintext firmware image (also sector-by-sector) without performing the swap operation. 
While there are performance optimizations possible, such as conveying hashes for 
each sector in the manifest rather than a hash of the entire firmware image, 
such optimizations are not described in this specification.</t>

<t>This approach of swapping the newly downloaded image with the previously valid 
image is often referred as A/B approach. A/B refers to the two slots involved.
Two slots are used to allow the update to be reversed in case the newly obtained
firmware image fails to boot. This approach adds robustness to the firmware 
update procedure.</t>

<t>Since the image in primary slot is available in cleartext it may need to 
re-encrypted it before copying it to the secondary slot. This may be necessary
when the secondary slot has different access permissions or when the staging
area is located in an off-chip flash memory and therefore more vulnerable to
physical attacks. Note that this description assumes that the processor does
not execute encrypted memory (i.e. using on-the-fly decryption in hardware).</t>

<t>The ability to restart an interrupted firmware update is often a requirement
for low-end IoT devices. To fulfill this requirement it is necessary to chunk
a firmware image into sectors and to encrypt each sector individually
using a cipher that does not increase the size of the resulting ciphertext 
(i.e., by not adding an authentication tag after each encrypted block).</t>

<t>When an update gets aborted while the bootloader is decrypting the newly obtained
image and swapping the sectors, the bootloader can restart where it left off. This
technique offers robustness and better performance.</t>

<t>For this purpose ciphers without integrity protection are used
to encrypt the firmware image. Integrity protection for the firmware image must,
however, be provided and the the suit-parameter-image-digest, defined in Section 
8.4.8.6 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>, MUST be used.</t>

<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-aes-ctr-and-cbc"/> registers AES Counter mode (AES-CTR) and 
AES Cipher Block Chaining (AES-CBC) ciphers that do not offer integrity protection. 
These ciphers are useful for the use cases that require firmware encryption on IoT
devices. For many other use cases where software packages, configuration information 
or personalization data needs to be encrypted, the use of Authenticated Encryption 
with Additional Data (AEAD) ciphers is preferred.</t>

<t>The following sub-sections provide further information about the initialization vector
(IV) selection for use with AES-CBC and AES-CTR in the firmware encryption context. An
IV MUST NOTE be re-used when the same key is used. For this application, the IVs are
not random but rather based on the slot/sector-combination in flash memory. The 
text below assumes that the block-size of AES is (much) smaller than sector size. The
typical sector-size of flash memory is in the order of KiB. Hence, multiple AES blocks
need to be decrypted until an entire sector is completed.</t>

<section anchor="aes-cbc"><name>AES-CBC</name>

<t>In AES-CBC a single IV is used for encryption of firmware belonging to a single sector
since individual AES blocks are chained toghether, as shown in <xref target="aes-cbc-fig"/>. The numbering 
of sectors in a slot MUST start with zero (0) and MUST increase by one with every sector
till the end of the slot is reached. The IV follows this numbering.</t>

<t>For example, let us assume the slot size of a specific flash controller on an IoT device 
is 64 KiB, the sector size 4096 bytes (4 KiB) and AES-128-CBC uses an AES-block size of
128 bit (16 bytes). Hence, sector 0 needs 4096/16=256 AES-128-CBC operations using IV 0.
If the firmware image fills the entire slot then that slot contains 16 sectors, i.e. IVs
ranging from 0 to 15.</t>

<section anchor="aes-ctr"><name>AES-CTR</name>

<t>Unlike AES-CBC, AES-CTR uses an IV per AES operation, as shown in <xref target="aes-ctr-fig"/>. 
Hence, when an image is encrypted using AES-CTR-128 or AES-CTR-256, the IV MUST
start with zero (0) and MUST be incremented by one for each 16-byte plaintext block
within the entire slot.</t>

<t>Using the previous example with a slot size of 64 KiB, the sector size 4096 bytes and
the AES plaintext block size of 16 byte requires IVs from 0 to 255 in the first sector
and 16 * 256 IVs for the remaining sectors in the slot. The last IV used to encrypt 
data in the slot is therefore</t>

<section anchor="sec-cons"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<t>The algorithms described in this document assume that the party performing payload encryption</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>shares a key-encryption key (KEK) with the recipient (for use with the AES Key Wrap scheme), or</t>
  <t>is in possession of the public key of the recipient (for use with ECDH-ES).</t>
</list></t>

<t>Both cases require some upfront communication interaction. This interaction is likely provided by
an IoT device management solution, as described in <xref target="RFC9019"/>.</t>

<t>For AES Key Wrap to provide high security it is important that the KEK is of high entropy, 
and that implementations protect the KEK from disclosure. Compromise of the KEK may result 
in the disclosure of all key data protected with that KEK.</t>

<t>Since the CEK is randomly generated, it must be ensured that the guidelines for random number 
generation in <xref target="RFC8937"/> are followed.</t>

<t>In some cases third party companies analyse binaries for known security vulnerabilities. With 
encrypted payloads this type of analysis is prevented. Consequently, these third party 
companies either need to be given access to the plaintext binary before encryption or they need 
to become authorized recipients of the encrypted payloads. In either case, it is necessary to 
explicitly consider those third parties in the software supply chain when such a binary analysis
is desired.</t>

   a bundle of metadata about code/data obtained by a recipient (chiefly
   the firmware for an IoT device), where to find the that code/data,
   the devices to which it applies, and cryptographic information

<abstract><t>Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the need for a reliable and secure firmware update mechanism that is also suitable for constrained devices. Ensuring that devices function and remain secure over their service lifetime requires such an update mechanism to fix vulnerabilities, update configuration settings, and add new functionality.</t><t>One component of such a firmware update is a concise and machine-processable metadata document, or manifest, that describes the firmware image(s) and offers appropriate protection.

<abstract><t>Randomness is a crucial ingredient for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and related security protocols.  Weak or predictable &quot;cryptographically secure&quot; pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) can be abused or exploited for malicious purposes. An initial entropy source that seeds a CSPRNG might be weak or broken as well, which can also lead to critical and systemic security problems. This document describes a way for security protocol implementations to augment their CSPRNGs using long-term private keys. This improves randomness from broken or otherwise subverted CSPRNGs.</t><t>This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) in the IRTF.</t></abstract>
